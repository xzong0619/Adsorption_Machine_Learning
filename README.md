# Machine Learning Models for Predicting Small Adsorbates Adsorption on Platinum Surfaces
This repository contains the workflow of predicting adsorption energies based on physical features using various machine learning models. 

The developed ML model can rapidly screen potential catalyst materials, unify adsorbate binding into a single model, and account for the variation of the site type that escapes the traditional scaling relations.
